# Trustiva 1.0 — Engineering Appraisal

Theme: Trustiva Classic (black with gold accents #C7A340)

Date: 2025‑10‑15

## Executive Summary

Trustiva 1.0 delivers a reproducible, test‑backed pipeline for publishing, verifying, and registering digital evidence using IPFS, AI quorum attestations, and on‑chain finalization via Solidity smart contracts. The system demonstrates production‑minded architecture, strong DevOps hygiene, and pragmatic tooling alignment across Python, Node, and Solidity ecosystems.

Overall rating: Exceeds expectations for an early product kernel. The remaining work is incremental hardening (tests, autosubmit policy, observability).

## Scope of Assessment

- Codebase: Ops API (FastAPI), AI swarm orchestrator, Next.js verification UI, Hardhat contracts and scripts, Docker Compose, Makefile pipeline, CI workflow.
- Verification artifacts: Python tests (Ops), Hardhat test (finalization gate), end‑to‑end local pipeline (deploy → finalize → register).
- Security posture: secret handling, IPFS publish verifications, finalization gate enforcement, minimal surface area.

## Architecture Overview

- Ops Layer: `services/api/main.py` exposes verification endpoints, registry resolution, XRPL live verification bridge, and a proxy to swarm attestation.
- AI Swarm: `ai_swarm/orchestrator.py` aggregates agent votes (proof, audit, XRPL, governance) and returns a quorum verdict.
- Chain Layer: `contracts/ProofChain.sol` finalizes roots; `contracts/AuditRegistry.sol` registers CID/root only when `isFinal(root)`.
- Web: `apps/web/app/registry/verify/page.jsx` provides in‑browser OpenPGP signature checks and verification UI.
- Tooling: Hardhat 2.22, ethers v6, Ganache; scripts for deploy and submit; Makefile for pipeline; Docker Compose for local devnet and services.

## Quality Gates

- Build: PASS (Node, Python, Solidity compile)
- Lint/Typecheck: N/A (linters not enforced in this snapshot; recommend enabling ESLint and Ruff/mypy)
- Tests: PASS
  - Python: Ops API tests green (see `tests/test_ops_api.py`)
  - Solidity: Finalization gate test green (see `test/AuditRegistry.cjs`)

## Security & Compliance

- Secrets are not embedded in repo; `.env`/Secrets expected. Guidance documented in runbook.
- IPFS publish script verifies gateway availability and CIDs; retries on propagation lag.
- Smart‑contract gate ensures only finalized roots enter the registry; submission script normalizes 32‑byte root.
- Optional XRPL live verification via websocket bridge; no private keys exposed by default.

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Insufficient Solidity test coverage | Medium | Medium | Add event/state tests, negative paths, and integration tests against fork |
| Swarm autosubmit policy missing | Medium | Medium | Implement autosubmit with quorum threshold, dry‑run, and rate‑limits |
| Observability gaps | Medium | Medium | Add structured logging, metrics, and dashboards |
| IPFS gateway variance | Low‑Med | Medium | Keep retries/backoff, multi‑gateway checks, and publish.json verification |

## Maturity Matrix

| Area | Current | Target |
|------|---------|--------|
| CI | Unit tests + build | Coverage gates, artifact retention |
| Contracts | Gate tested | Broader tests + audits |
| Ops | Functional | Structured logs + metrics |
| Web | Verify UI | Error states + regression tests |
| Swarm | Quorum only | Policy + autosubmit + tests |

## Recommendations (next 90 days)

1. Expand Solidity tests (events, reverts, cross‑contract state) and add integration tests using Hardhat network forks.
2. Implement swarm autosubmit with safety rails (quorum threshold, dry‑run, rate‑limit) and add policy unit tests.
3. Add observability: OpenTelemetry/Prometheus metrics, distributed tracing for Ops and Swarm.
4. Harden CI: caching, coverage thresholds, publish artifacts (publish.json, CID) to job summary.
5. Frontend: enrich error states, invalid CID/signature cases, and add smoke tests.
